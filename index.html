          <a href="#">automotive</a> and <a href="#">clean energy</a> company
          headquartered in <a href="#">Austin, Texas</a>, which designs and
          manufactures <a href="#">electric vehicles</a> (<a href="#">cars</a>

          subsidiary <a href="#">Tesla Energy</a> develops and is a major
          installer of <a href="#">photovoltaic systems</a> in the United States
          and is one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage

          2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tesla is one of the
          <a href="#">world's most valuable companies</a> and, as of 2023, is
          the world's most valuable automaker. In 2022, the company led the

        />
        <p>
          Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by
          <a href="#">Martin Eberhard</a> and <a href="#">Marc Tarpenning</a> as
          Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and
          electrical engineer <a href="#">Nikola Tesla</a>. In February 2004,
          via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the company's largest
          shareholder. He became CEO in 2008. Tesla's announced mission is to
          create products which help "accelerate the world’s
          <a href="#">transition to sustainable energy</a>."
        </p>
        <p>
          The company began production of its first car model, the
          <a href="#">Roadster</a>
          sports car, in 2008. This was followed by the
          <a href="#">Model S</a> sedan in 2012, the
          <a href="#">Model X SUV</a> in 2015, the <a href="#">Model 3</a> sedan
          in 2017, the <a href="#">Model Y crossover</a> in 2020, the
          <a href="#">Tesla Semi</a>
          truck in 2022 and the <a href="#">Cybertruck</a> light-duty
          <a href="#">pickup truck</a> in 2023.[7] The Model 3 is the all-time
          bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 became
          the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[8] Tesla's
          2023 deliveries were around 1.8 million vehicles, a 38% increase over
          the previous year,[9] and cumulative sales totaled 4 million cars as
          of April 2023.[10] In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization
          temporarily reached $1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S.
          history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and
          journalistic <a href="#">criticism</a>, stemming from allegations of
          <a href="#">whistleblower</a> retaliation,
          <a href="#">worker rights</a> violations, product defects, and Musk's
          many controversial statements.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          <em>Main article: <a href="#">History of Tesla, Inc</a></em>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Founding (2003–2004)</strong></h3>
        <p>
          The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by
          <a href="#">Martin Eberhard</a> and <a href="#">Marc Tarpenning</a>.
          Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively. Eberhard
          said that he wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is also a
          technology company", with its core technologies as "the battery, the
          computer software, and the proprietary motor"
        </p>
        <p>
          Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later. In
          February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12
          million in 2022) in <a href="#">series A funding</a>, including $6.5
          million (equivalent to $10 million in 2022) from Elon Musk, who had
          received $100 million from the sale of his interest in
          <a href="#">PayPal</a> two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of
          the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla.
          <a href="#">J. B. Straubel</a> joined Tesla in May 2004 as
          <a href="#">chief technical officer</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009
          allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel –
          to call themselves co-founders.
        </p>
        <h3>Roadster (2005–2009)</h3>
        <p>
          <em
            >Main article: <a href="#">Tesla Roadster (first generation)</a></em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Elon Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster
          product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in
          day-to-day business operations.[19] The company's strategy was to
          start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move
          into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable
          compacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B
          <a href="#">venture capital funding</a>
          round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding
          team. Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw
          investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders
          <a href="#">Sergey Brin</a> and <a href="#">Larry Page</a>, and former
          eBay President <a href="#">Jeff Skoll</a>. A fourth round worth $45
          million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to
          over $105 million.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tesla's first car, the Roadster, was officially revealed to the public
          on July 19, 2006, in <a href="#">Santa Monica, California</a>, at a
          350-person invitation-only event held in
          <a href="#">Barker Hangar</a> at Santa Monica Airport.
        </p>
        <h3>IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015)</h3>
        <p>
          In May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the
          <a href="#">Tesla Factory</a> in <a href="#">Fremont, California</a>,
          from Toyota for $42 million, and opened the facility in October 2010
          to start production of the Model S. On June 29, 2010, the company went
          public via an <a href="#">initial public offering</a> (IPO) on the
          <a href="#">NASDAQ</a>, the first American car company to do so since
          the <a href="#">Ford Motor Company</a> had its IPO in 1956. The
          company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17
          per share, raising $226 million.
        </p>
        <p>
          In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June
          the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan. The
          Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including
          the 2013 <a href="#">Motor Trend Car of the Year</a>, and became the
          first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when
          it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in
          September 2013. The Model S was also the bestselling plug-in electric
          car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tesla announced the <a href="#">Tesla Autopilot</a>, a
          driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla
          cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the
          feature, with what would later be called "hardware version 1".
        </p>
        <h3>SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018)</h3>
        <p>
          Tesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with
          the purchase of <a href="#">SolarCity</a>, in an all-stock $2.6
          billion deal. The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery
          energy storage products division to form the
          <a href="#">Tesla Energy</a> subsidiary. The deal was controversial
          because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity
          issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed. In February
          2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect
          the scope of its expanded business.
        </p>
        <p>
          This period of production hell put significant financial pressure on
          Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most
          <a href="#">shorted</a>
          companies in the market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues,
          Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla
          private. The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much
          controversy and many lawsuits including a
          <a href="#">securities fraud charge from the SEC</a>, which would
          force Musk to step down as the company's chairman, although he was
          allowed to remain CEO.

          range of 500 miles (800 km). Two prototype trucks were first shown in
          November 2017 and initial deliveries were made to
          <a href="#">PepsiCo</a> on December 1, 2022. As of July 2023, the
          truck remains in pilot production,[3] and Tesla does not expect the
          truck to enter volume production before 2024, due to limited
          availability of the required 4680 battery cells.

          <a href="#">EPA range</a> estimates of 320–340 miles (510–550 km),
          depending on the model. The truck's exterior design made from flat
